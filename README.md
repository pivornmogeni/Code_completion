sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key.
#task 1 analysis
Analysis (200 Words):
Both implementations aim to sort a list of dictionaries by a specific key. The AI-suggested version uses Python's built-in sorted() function with a lambda to access dictionary values by key. This method is concise, readable, and leverages Timsort (Python’s hybrid sorting algorithm), which has an average and worst-case time complexity of O(n log n). It also avoids mutating the original list, returning a new one instead.

The manual implementation uses a classic bubble sort algorithm. Although instructive, bubble sort is significantly less efficient with a worst-case time complexity of O(n²). It also modifies the original list in place, which may be undesirable in some use cases. While this manual approach helps understand sorting mechanics, it lacks practicality in performance-critical or large-scale applications.

In conclusion, the AI-suggested method is more efficient, robust, and Pythonic. It is preferable for real-world applications due to better performance and cleaner syntax. The manual method is educational but should be avoided outside learning contexts or niche cases requiring full control over sorting logic.

4. 150-Word Summary
Summary:
Automated testing using Selenium IDE with AI plugins (or AI-powered platforms like Testim.io) significantly improves the efficiency and reliability of UI test execution. In this example, we automated login functionality testing for both valid and invalid credential scenarios. AI-enhanced tools improve coverage by auto-suggesting edge cases, generating test steps based on user behavior, and self-healing broken locators when UI changes. Compared to manual testing, AI-augmented automation can run hundreds of tests in seconds, covering more combinations and conditions while reducing human error. It also provides real-time analytics and failure insights, helping developers fix bugs faster. The automation script ensures consistent and repeatable testing, essential for CI/CD environments. This enhances software quality, accelerates delivery, and reduces long-term QA costs.
